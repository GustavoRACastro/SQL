# SQL
Training SQL

The objective of these consults, is to practice the basics from SQL. I've created a Database called 'Locadora', our old Netflix where you rent some movies for low prices, and there was the coding beginning.

1st Create the tables, columns and keys.
2nd Insert the data to work on it. For the tables 'Clientes' (Client) and 'Locação' (Location), I've used a Python code generated by ChatGPT, to create Random data and accelerate the project.
3rd Created some questions to answer with the SQL consults.
